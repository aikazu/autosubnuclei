### Progress Summary
Significant progress has been made on fixing high-priority issues. The configuration file path handling has been improved to support execution from any directory. The tool installation process now includes robust error handling with retry mechanisms and fallback strategies. The next focus will be on fixing tool path issues on Windows (T007) and optimizing memory usage for large scans (T002).

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Fix Windows PATH issues (T007)
2. Optimize memory usage for large scans (T002)
3. Add more detailed logging (T004)
4. Implement thorough testing for the updated components

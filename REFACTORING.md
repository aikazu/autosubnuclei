## Conclusion

The refactoring plan has successfully improved code maintainability while preserving functionality. By breaking down complex nested methods into smaller, focused components, we have enhanced code readability, testability, and maintainability while reducing the cognitive load for developers working with the codebase.

The comprehensive test suite provides a safety net for the changes, ensuring that the refactored code maintains the same behavior as the original implementation. 

The refactoring of all identified methods has successfully addressed the issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. We have:

1. **Reduced Method Complexity**: By breaking down large methods into smaller, focused helper methods
2. **Improved Code Readability**: Through more descriptive method names and single-responsibility functions
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Each component can now be understood and modified independently
4. **Simplified Control Flow**: By using early returns and avoiding deep nesting of conditionals
5. **Separated Concerns**: File handling, validation, progress tracking, checkpoint management, and platform-specific code now have distinct responsibilities
6. **Applied Design Patterns**: Used Strategy pattern to handle platform-specific code cleanly

All unit tests are passing, confirming that the refactoring has preserved the original functionality while improving code structure. The next phase will focus on integration testing to ensure all components work correctly together.

These improvements will make the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and debug in the future, reducing technical debt and allowing for more efficient development.

# Session: Implementation Progress

## Session Goals
- Implement fixes for high-priority tasks
- Fix configuration file path handling
- Improve error handling in tool installation

## Active Tasks
- **T001**: Improve error handling in tool installation (90% complete)
- **T003**: Fix configuration file path handling (90% complete)
- **T007**: Fix tool path issues on Windows (next to be implemented)
- **T002**: Optimize memory usage for large scans (waiting for testing)

## Files Modified
- autosubnuclei/config/config_manager.py (updated config file path handling)
- autosubnuclei/utils/helpers.py (added retry_with_backoff function)
- autosubnuclei/utils/tool_manager.py (improved error handling and verification)
- TASK.md (updated task progress)
- SUBTASK-T001.md (updated implementation status)
- SUBTASK-T003.md (updated implementation status)
- SESSION.md (this file)

## Recent Decisions
- Implemented retry mechanism for network operations with exponential backoff
- Created a robust config file discovery system to support execution from any directory
- Added multiple fallback strategies for GitHub API failures
- Enhanced download verification for better error detection

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of T007: Fix tool path issues on Windows
- Test the implemented solutions thoroughly on different environments
- Continue work on T002: Optimize memory usage for large scans
- Add proper unit tests for the updated components

## Questions and Clarifications Needed
- Confirm if the implemented solutions work correctly on different operating systems
- Determine if additional fallback mechanisms are needed for API failures
- Check if additional verification measures are needed for downloaded tools

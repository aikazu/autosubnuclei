# AutoSubNuclei Planning

## Project Vision

AutoSubNuclei aims to be a comprehensive, user-friendly, and efficient security scanning solution that automates the entire workflow from subdomain discovery to vulnerability detection. The project strives to provide a seamless experience for security professionals by integrating best-in-class tools while abstracting away the complexity of managing these tools individually.

## Goals

1. Simplify the security scanning process through automation
2. Maintain a self-contained environment that requires minimal setup
3. Provide real-time feedback and notifications during scanning
4. Optimize performance for large-scale scans
5. Support extensibility for future tool integration

## Milestones and Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)
- ✅ Integration of Subfinder for subdomain discovery
- ✅ Integration of Httpx for HTTP probing
- ✅ Integration of Nuclei for vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Basic command-line interface
- ✅ Automatic tool installation

### Phase 2: Performance and Usability Enhancements (In Progress)
- ✅ Asynchronous processing
- ✅ Caching for improved performance
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Notifications
- ⬜ Comprehensive error handling
- ⬜ Improved logging
- ⬜ Better result formatting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- ⬜ Integration with additional security tools
- ⬜ Scan scheduling
- ⬜ Web interface for scan management
- ⬜ Scan comparison capabilities
- ⬜ Custom scanning profiles
- ⬜ Report generation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Scans should process subdomains in parallel to maximize throughput
- Resource usage should scale appropriately based on system capabilities
- Caching mechanism should improve repeat scan performance by at least 50%

### Usability
- CLI should be intuitive and follow common patterns
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Installation should require minimal steps and dependencies

### Reliability
- Tool should gracefully handle network issues and timeouts
- Scan state should be persistently stored to recover from interruptions
- Regular updates should maintain compatibility with the latest tool versions

### Security
- No sensitive data should be stored in plain text
- Configuration with credentials should be stored securely
- Tools should be verified for integrity before execution

## Development Approach

AutoSubNuclei follows an iterative development approach with continuous improvements based on user feedback. The project is developed with the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independent and reusable
2. **Testability**: Core functionality is tested with automated tests
3. **Documentation**: Code is documented for maintainability
4. **User-Centered**: Features are prioritized based on user needs

## Integration Points

- **External Tools**: Subfinder, Httpx, Nuclei
- **Notification Services**: Discord
- **Future Potential**: Integration with vulnerability management systems, CI/CD pipelines
